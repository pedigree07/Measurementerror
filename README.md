This repository has R codes for Online Updating Method to Correct for Measurement Error in Big Data Streams

Data_gene.R generate simulated data

Update_theta.R calculate the proposed online updating estimates which are the corrected coefficient estimates and corrected SSE

SE.R calculate the suggested standard errors of the corrected coefficient estimates

Example.R provides an example how to perform online updating estimates with the above codes  and a simulated data
